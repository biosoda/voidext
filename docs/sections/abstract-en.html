<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
 Yet, semantic heterogeneity remains a problem when interoperating data from  sources of different scopes and knowledge domains. 
 Causes for this challenge are context-specific requirements (i.e. no "one model fits all"), different modelling decisions, 
 domain purpose, and technical constraints. Moreover,  even if the problem of semantic heterogeneity among different RDF 
 publishers and knowledge domains is solved, querying and accessing the data of distributed RDF datasets on the Web 
 is not straightforward. This is because of the complex and fastidious process needed to understand how these datasets 
 can be related or linked, and consequently, queried. To address this issue, we propose to extend the existing Vocabulary of 
 Interlinked Datasets (VoID). We introduce the virtual link set concept. A virtual link is a connection between resources such as 
 literals and IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifier) with some commonality where each of these resources is from a different RDF 
 dataset. The links are required in order to understand how to semantically relate the datasets. In addition, we argue several benefits
  of using virtual links to improve interoperability between unlike datasets. Finally, we applied them to multiple worldwide used RDF datasets.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
To perform semantic interoperability, numerous data standards, ontologies, controlled vocabularies have been developed and
adopted by the industry and scientific communities. Yet, semantic heterogeneity remains a problem when interoperating data
from various data sources of different domain scopes and knowledge domains. This is mostly because of the lack or difficulty 
of a common consensus (i.e. ``one model fits all"), different modelling decisions, domain purpose, and constraints
 (e.g. scalability, legacy and new systems). Moreover,  even if the problem of semantic heterogeneity among different
  RDF publishers and knowledge domains is mitigated or solved, to query and access the data of multiple distributed RDF 
  datasets on the web is not straightforward. This is because of the complex and fastidious process to understand how 
  the data are structured and how these datasets can be related or linked, and consequently, queried. To address these 
  issues, we hereby propose an extension of the existing Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID), so-called  Extended VoID (VoIDext), 
that is backward-compatible with VoID-based assertions. We introduce the concept of virtual links. A virtual link is a connection 
between resources such as literals and IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifier) with some 
  commonality where each of these resources is from a different RDF dataset. Semantic relaxation is also considered when 
  defining commonality between resources. The links are required in order to understand how to semantically relate the datasets.
   This extension enhances interoperability among heterogeneous and distributed RDF datasets by bridging them through 
   explicitly defined virtual links.

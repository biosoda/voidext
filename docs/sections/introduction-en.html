<p> The semantic interoperability addresses the exchange of the data meaning.
 Yet, semantic heterogeneity remains a problem when interoperating data from various sources which represent the same 
 or related information in different ways. This is mainly due to the lack or difficulty of a common consensus, 
 different modelling decisions, domain scope and purpose, and constraints (e.g. storage, query performance, legacy and new systems).
</p>
<p>The semantic reconciliation (i.e. the process of identifying and resolving semantic conflicts, for example, by matching 
concepts from heterogeneous data sources) is identified as a key process to address the semantic heterogeneity problem. 
Although the semantic reconciliation enhances semantic interoperability, it is not often fully applicable or possible (e.g. missing data schema)
  when considering distributed and independent RDF (Resource Description Framework) datasets of different domain scopes, 
  knowledge domains, and publishers. This is due to the fact that the semantic reconciliation process mostly focuses on having as a result 
  aligned data schemas, or terminological boxes (TBox) of distinct knowledge bases rather than focusing on improving 
  interoperability at the data level - i.e. the assertion box (ABox). In addition, even if the semantic 
  reconciliation process among different RDF publishers and knowledge domains is complete and possible, to query and access 
  the data of multiple distributed RDF datasets on the web is not straightforward. This is because of the complex, 
  time-consuming and fastidious process to understand and know how the data are structured and how these datasets can be 
  related or linked, and consequently, queried.
</p>
<p>To enhance semantic interoperability at the data level and to facilitate the understanding of how multiple datasets 
can be related and queried, we hereby extended the existing <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/void/">Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID)</a>.
 VoID is an RDF Schema vocabulary used to describe metadata about RDF datasets such as structural metadata, 
 access metadata and links between datasets.  
 However, VoID is quite limited in what concerns providing terms and patterns to describe semantic 
 relations between datasets. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the concept of virtual links. 
 A virtual link is an intersection data point between two RDF datasets. 
 A data point is any node or resource in an RDF graph such as literals and IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifier). 
 The links are required in order to understand how to semantically relate datasets and, for instance, to enable performing 
 SPARQL federated queries, given that they act as joint points between the federated sources.

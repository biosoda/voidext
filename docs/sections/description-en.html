<h2 id="desc" class="list">Extended Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoIDext): Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>

<p>The complexity of quickly achieving semantic interoperability substantially increases when considering 
distributed and independent RDF datasets on the Web. The reasons for that can be summarized as follows:  
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Thanks to Semantic Web standards, large datasets are now machine-readable. Nevertheless, 
 just adopting these standards, like just using Web Ontology Language (OWL), does not
  eliminate semantic heterogeneity for good: it elevates heterogeneity problems at a higher level 
  (e.g. data schema).
  </li><li>Improving semantic interoperability with semantic reconciliation among RDF data publishers 
  is often not conceivable or requires fastidious and time-consuming efforts to have a consensus in 
  terms of data modelling decisions and semantic interpretations.  
  </li>  <li> RDF datasets can be published with incomplete or missing data schemas and they 
  frequently do not include how to semantically relate with other relevant third-party datasets. 
  This considerable harden the task of manually or automatically writing federated queries, for example,
   with SPARQL 1.1 query language.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>To mitigate the inherent difficulty of establishing semantic interoperability, we hereby propose a 
vocabulary and patterns to describe the semantic relations among datasets. This vocabulary so-called 
VoIDext is actually an extension and an adaptation of the well-accepted VoID RDF schema vocabulary. 
In this documentation, the words vocabulary and ontology are interchangeably used. The proposed VoID 
extension is a meta-ontology that describes semantic  links between RDF datasets - virtual links. 
</p>


<h3>Virtual links between RDF datasets</h3>


<p>An RDF dataset is ``a set of RDF triples that are published, maintained or aggregated by a single provider" 
according to the <a href="http://rdfs.org/ns/void">VoID specification</a>. RDF datasets are often  independent
 and distributed on the Web. A virtual link is a connection between common resources such as literals and
  instances from two  different RDF datasets. Semantic relaxation is also considered when identifying common 
   resources between datasets. For example, the datasets might use different prefix namespaces for similar 
   instances in a given domain scope.
</p>
<p> A virtual link can be interpreted as an intersection data point between two datasets. In addition,
 a virtual link is not explicitly and concretely stored. The link may be physically established, for example,
  during a conjunctive federated query execution. Virtual links can simply be predicates (i.e. relations) 
  in one dataset where subjects and objects of the triples are present in disparate datasets. The types of
   resources involved in a virtual link can be also a valuable information. Another type of virtual 
   link can be stated when two datasets share the same instances of a given type. These instances 
   usually do not have exactly the same description or context in each dataset.
</p>
<p> 
Moreover, distinct datasets can state different predicates with the same or similar subjects and objects. 
By considering these subjects and objects that are in common, the RDF graphs from these datasets may establish
 two types of intersection nodes (i.e. matched nodes): object-object, subject-subject, and subject-object. 
 For example, given the following RDF triples T<sub>a</sub> = (S<sub>a</sub>,P<sub>a</sub>, O<sub>a</sub>) in dataset "a" and 
  T<sub>b</sub>=(S<sub>b</sub>,P<sub>b</sub>, O<sub>b</sub>) in dataset b; if O<sub>a</sub> &equiv; O<sub>b</sub> then we can state a virtual link between
   O<sub>a</sub> and O<sub>b</sub>; and if S<sub>a</sub> &equiv; S<sub>a</sub> then we can state a virtual link between S<sub>a</sub> and S<sub>b</sub>; 
   and finally if S<sub>a</sub>&equiv; O<sub>b</sub> then we can state a virtual link between S<sub>a</sub> and O<sub>b</sub>. 
   The &equiv; symbol represents equivalent subjects or objects. One could also imagine the case of O<sub>a</sub>
    being similar to O<sub>b</sub> (i.e. O<sub>a</sub> \sim O<sub>b</sub>). In this case, a resource mapping function f<sub>m</sub>(r) is
     required to establish a virtual link between O<sub>a</sub> and O<sub>b</sub> --- i.e. O<sub>a</sub> &equiv; f<sub>m</sub>(O<sub>b</sub>) or f<sub>m</sub>(O<sub>a</sub>)
      &equiv; O<sub>b</sub>. This is due to the fact of existing heterogeneities in the representation of a resource 
      (e.g. "id:1234" or "id_1234" strings) and the resource description, for example, different set of
       predicates to contextualize a similar resource in different datasets and domain scopes. 
</p>

<p>Finally, we can also mention the fact of two separated datasets sharing the same instance IRIs, 
nevertheless they are asserted as instances of unlike classes (i.e. types). Yet, a virtual link can be 
stated between these instances. This fact might be because of distinct domain scopes and constraints such
 as legacy information systems. 
</p>
<p>Although, the  examples in this specification are based on existing life sciences RDF datasets on the Web, 
<b>VoIDext can be applied to any knowledge domain</b>. The RDF data may be accessible through SPARQL endpoints.
 The considered datasets in this specification are as follows:
 <a href="https://omabrowser.org">OMA (Orthologous MAtrix)</a> , 
 <a href="https://uniprot.org">UniProtKB (UniProt Knowledgebase)</a>,
 <a href=""> Drugbank </a>,
 <a href="https://bgee.org"> Bgee (dataBase for Gene Expression Evolution)</a> , 
 and <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf">EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute) RDF platform </a>. 
 <a href="#tab_endpoints">Table 2</a> lists the SPARQL endpoints of these datasets.

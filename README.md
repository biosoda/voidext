## Supporting Virtual Links with the Extended Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoIDext)

This RDF schema vocabulary (TBox) is documented in the [VoIDext Vocabulary Specification Draft](https://biosoda.github.io/voidext/). 
In addition, the "voidext_with_import.ttl" file is the VoIDext RDF Turtle serialisation including imported ontologies.
VoIDext is also accesible via the [SPARQL endpoint here](http://biosoda.expasy.org:8890/sparql).

## Exemplar data (ABox SAMOD process)
The exemplar data assertion box (ABox1) used to build the VoIDext is available in [ABox_examplar_data](ABox_examplar_data).
Both  "ABox_paper_examples.ttl" and "ABox_application.ttl" files were considered during the VoIDext development.

## Virtual links for OMA-UniProt-Bgee RDF datasets  
The real case study  assertion box (ABox) according to VoIDext is available in [ABox_examplar_data](ABox_examplar_data).

Under-development application with [federated query templates](https://github.com/biosoda/bioquery/tree/master/Queries) available at http://biosoda.expasy.org/ . 
These queries are  defined based on the virtual link metadata [ABox_application.ttl](ABox_examplar_data). 

## The set of SPARQL queries (SQ) along with the competency questions (CQ)
The formal set of queries to answer the informal competency questions during the development of VoIDext is available in
 [ABox_paper_examples.ttl](ABox_examplar_data)
These queries can be executed on the [SPARQL endpoint here](http://biosoda.expasy.org:8890/sparql).
